# IRCTC-Project
 Railway management system like IRCTC, where users can come on the platform and
check if there are any trains available between 2 stations.
And also display how many seats are available between any 2 stations and the user can book a seat if the availability > 0 after
logging in. Since this has to be real-time and multiple users can book seats simultaneously, your code must be optimized enough to handle
large traffic and should not fail while doing any bookings.
If more than 1 users simultaneously try to book seats, only either one of the users should be able to book. Handle such race conditions
